                        <p>1. STE Tokens are based on the Ethereum protocol and conform to the ERC-20 standard.</p>

                        or any other form of participation in or relating to STE. </p>

                        or endorsed by Streamex and have no relationship in any way with Streamex. The only official and authorized website and STE Tokens distribution provider is the Website available in the Internet via
                        https://www.Streamex.io/ The Participant must ensure that the URL of your web browser indicates that it is using a hypertext transport protocol secure connection (“https”) and that the domain name is correct
                        (this provision may do not apply to personal or individual TSA’s, which Streamex may conclude with certain Participants, conditions of which may vary from mentioned hereof).</p>
                        <p>Streamex reserves the right to use services of third party services for processing of payments for STE Tokens.</p>

                        <p>15. STE Tokens are digital cryptographic Tokens which are software digital products (not being cryptocurrency), created by Streamex as a cryptographically secured representation of an operational instrument which
                        give the Participant the right to use STE Tokens on the Platform as well as receive the following rights:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                to acquire and use STE Tokens in any way that is allowed by these Terms, TSA;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                to receive access for relevant software, that was developed by the Company and to Streamex Platform, depending on the results of the token sale and within framework of the Company’s possibilities;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                to use STE Tokens on the Platform as it is prescribed in the clause 17 of the Terms, depending on the results of the Token Sale and within frameworks of the Team possibilities. Pay additional attention to the
                                fact, that some of the rights will be grunted upon successful development of the exact Platform feature.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Information regarding how we collect, store, transfer Your Personal Data can be found in the Privacy Policy, that is also published on the Website and is a part of the Accompanying Documents.</p>
                        <p>16.The Purchase Amounts made by Purchasers for STE are final, thus, no refunds are cancelations offered. </p>
                        <p>17. As were said in the art.1, the Tokens are being created as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum protocol. We reserve the right to migrate the ERC-20 based Tokens to another protocol and to generate replacement Tokens
                        on the new protocol in the future, should we determine, in our sole discretion, that doing so is necessary or useful to the operation of the Platform.</p>
                        <p>18. Should we decide to migrate the Tokens, we may no longer provide support for the Tokens on the Ethereum protocol relating to the Ecosystem, the Services, or any other operational matters, except with respect
                        to the migration process. Although Company does not at this time anticipate that it will require any Token holders to convert their Tokens on the Ethereum protocol to Tokens on another protocol, Company
                        anticipates there will be significant incentives for owners of Tokens on the Ethereum protocol to do so, since the practical utility of such Tokens will likely diminish rapidly once the replacement Tokens are
                        created and in use by a significant portion of Ecosystem participants.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, by accepting these Terms you acknowledge and agree that in order for you to continue to participate in the Ecosystem or obtain utility from the Tokens you may need to convert the Tokens you purchase
                        during the Streamex Token Sale to replacement Tokens in the future</p>
                        <p>Should we decide to migrate the Tokens, we will notify you via the email address you provided to us at the time of the Token Sale. You are solely responsible for updating us should your contact information
                        change.</p>
                        <h4>Appendix B</h4>
                        <h5>RISKS</h5>
                        <p>The Participant understand that STE Tokens, blockchain technology, Ethereum, Ether and other associated and related technologies are new and untested and outside of Streamex’ exclusive control and adverse changes
                        in market forces or the technology, broadly construed, may prevent or compromise Streamex performance under these Terms.</p>
                        <p>Participant agree that no other party (including, without limitation any) may be held liable for any loss arising out of, or in any way connected with Participant’s participation in the STE Tokens-sale, or
                        receiving and holding Tokens or such risk.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the above, the Participant also acknowledge that prior to receiving Tokens he have been warned of the following risks, associated with the Website, the Streamex Tokens, the Platform and other
                        relevant technologies mentioned herein:</p>
                        <p>A) Legal risks regarding securities regulations</p>
                        <p>There is a risk that in some jurisdictions the STE Tokens might be considered to be a security, or that it might be considered to be a security in the future. Streamex does not give warranties or guarantees that
                        STE Tokens are not a security in all jurisdictions. Each holder of STE Tokens shall bear its own legal or financial consequences of STE Tokens being considered a security in their respective jurisdiction. </p>
                        <p>Every Participant is bound to check if acquisition and disposal of STE Tokens is legal in his jurisdiction, and by accepting these Terms, each Participant undertakes not to use STE Tokens should their use not be
                        legal in the relevant jurisdiction. If a Participant establishes that the use of STE Tokens under these Terms is not legal in his jurisdiction, You should not use the STE Tokens, not acquire them and should
                        immediately stop using or possessing them if such case arises.</p>
                        <p>Acquiring cryptographic Tokens for personal possession and exchanging them for other cryptographic Tokens will most likely continue to be scrutinized by various regulatory bodies around the world, which has so far
                        given mixed reactions and regulatory impact. The legal ability of Streamex to provide STE Tokens and the Platform in some jurisdictions may be eliminated by future regulation or legal actions. In the event, it
                        turns out with a high degree certainty that STE Tokens are not legal in certain jurisdiction, Streamex will either:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>cease operations in that jurisdiction, or</li>
                            <li>adjust STE Tokens and the Platform in a way to comply with the regulation should that be possible and viable.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>B) Risks associated with Ethereum </p>
                        <p>STE are based on Ethereum blockchain. As such, any malfunction, unintended function or unexpected functioning of the Ethereum protocol may cause the STE Tokens to malfunction or function in an unexpected or
                        unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum may itself lose value in ways similar to STE Tokens, and also other ways. </p>
                        <p>C) Risk of unfavourable regulatory action in one or more jurisdictions </p>
                        <p>Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The functioning of the Ethereum network and associated blockchain networks and STE Tokens could be impacted
                        by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of digital Tokens like STE Tokens, which could impede or limit their existence, permissibility of
                        their use and possession, and their value.</p>
                        <p>D) Risk of theft and hacking</p>
                        <p>Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with Your Third-party Wallet, the Website or the availability of STE Tokens and Digital Assets in any number of ways, including without limitation
                        denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks. You hereby agree that Streamex shall have no liability for any such loss the Participant incur. </p>
                        <p>E) Risk of security weaknesses in the Website and/or STE Tokens source code or any associated software and/or infrastructure</p>
                        <p>There is a risk that the Website and STE Tokens may unintentionally include weaknesses or bugs in the source code interfering with the use of or causing the loss of STE Tokens.</p>
                        <p>F) Risk of weaknesses or exploitable breakthroughs in the field of cryptography</p>
                        <p>Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies, Ethereum, STE Tokens, the Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of
                        STE Tokens.</p>
                        <p>G) Risk of mining attacks</p>
                        <p>As with other decentralized cryptocurrencies, Ethereum blockchain, which is used for the STE Tokens, is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power
                        attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the STE Tokens, expected proper execution and sequencing of STE Tokens, and expected proper execution and
                        sequencing of Ethereum contract computations in general. Despite the efforts of Streamex and Ethereum Foundation, the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists. Mining Attacks, as described above, may also
                        target other blockchain networks, with which the STE Tokens interact with and consequently the STE Tokens may be impacted in that way to the extent, described above.</p>
                        <p>H) Risk of uninsured losses</p>
                        <p>STE Tokens are unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions and are entirely uninsured.</p>
                        <p>I) Risk of malfunction in the Ethereum network or any other blockchain</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the Ethereum network or any other network, to which the STE Tokens are interacting with, malfunctions in an unfavourable way, including but not limited to one that result in the loss of STE
                        Tokens</p>
                        <p>J) Internet transmission risks</p>
                        <p>The Participant acknowledge that there are risks associated with using the STE Tokens including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software, and Internet connections. The Participant acknowledge that
                        Streamex shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays You may experience when using the Website and STE Tokens, howsoever caused.</p>
                        <p>K) Unanticipated risks</p>
                        <p>Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are new and untested technology. In addition to the risks set forth here, there are risks that Streamex cannot foresee and it is unreasonable to believe that such risks could have
                        been foreseeable. Risks may further materialize as unanticipated.</p>
                        <p>L) Insufficient interest in Streamex, the Platform and STE Tokens</p>
                        <p>It is possible that Streamex, STE Tokens or Platform will not be used by a large number of individuals, businesses and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and
                        development of its functionalities. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Platform.</p>
                        <p>M) STE Tokens and the Platform, as developed, may not meet the Participant’s expectations</p>
                        <p>
                            The Platform is currently under development and may undergo significant changes before release. The Participant’s expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Platform and STE Tokens may not be met
                        upon release of new Website, deployment of the Platform, additional products and services for any number of reasons, including a change in the design , business model, and implementation plans and execution of
                        the implementation of STE Tokens.</p>
